Title: Basic C++ Implementation: Numerical Integration Methods

Problem Statement: Implement a C++ program that demonstrates your understanding of basic programming concepts learned in your first year of college. The program should include functions, loops, switch statements, and basic mathematical operations. You are required to implement numerical integration methods, including Simpson's (1/3)th rule, Simpson's (3/8)th rule, Trapezoidal rule, and the Runge-Kutta 4th Order rule. The program should allow users to choose a function, specify the integration limits and interval, and select the type of solution (direct or detailed). It should provide step-by-step solutions for each method, helping users understand the underlying principles of numerical analysis.

Description: This project serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental C++ programming concepts acquired in the first year of college. It showcases the implementation of numerical integration methods, which are essential techniques in numerical analysis for approximating definite integrals. By allowing users to interactively choose functions, set integration limits, and select solution types, the program provides an engaging learning experience. The detailed step-by-step solutions offered by the program help users grasp the underlying mathematical concepts behind each integration method. Overall, this project not only demonstrates your proficiency in C++ programming but also highlights your ability to apply programming skills to solve real-world mathematical problems.
